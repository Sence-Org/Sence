Hello! As the title says, it's alive! I'm alive, Sence is alive, or well, has been revived. The great thing about having a website with no users but yourself and a couple of friends is that you basically have no commitments or obligations other than the ones you set for yourself. No one expects anything from you but yourself. Which is better than other individuals having already set expectations for you.

Anyways, it's been a while since I've worked on Sence. Everything's mostly the same (as you can see), lots of stuff happened. Exams, periods of absolute torment and grind for said exams, discovery of great artists (huge Olivia Rodrigo fan now), and a bit of thinking. I thought about what I wanted Sence to be, and what it can be. The idea for Sence was originally a "thinking club." And yeah, I think it *could* be that, no problem. But do I *want* it to be that?

Short answer: Sure.
Long answer: Meh, maybe.

I realized that, I wanted Sence to be a materialization of my inner thoughts and ramblings. A fancy diary, an echo chamber that anyone can check out. And if they liked what they heard, then they can stick around. I didn't want Sence to grow into this big MENSA-esqe entity that I ultimately have to walk a very fine line to keep true to what I had for it in mind. And that realization gave me the best peace of mind I've had in a while.

I took Sence very seriously when me and Sam started it. *Too* seriously I think. And that was because I had the wrong idea for it. Now that I know what I *really* want Sence to be, I love it a lot more. And I'm super ready to work on it again. Whether anyone checks it out or not, I won't care that much. I'll just be happy that it exists. And I won't strive for it to have a ton of users either. Maybe a reader or two, or maybe even ten.

Man, writing this post felt good. I'm feeling good about this.
