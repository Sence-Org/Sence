I wouldn't call this really a post. More so a note (as the title suggests) regarding this specific time-period in the lifespan of Sence. There is a lot of work to be done, lots of changes to be implemented so that Sence gets out of its current state. Over the next couple of weeks I will focus on developing Sence and only on developing Sence. I won't put out that many (if any at all) posts. Hopefully it won't be like that for long, however I don't intend to rush its development. For now, your patience would be appreciated. You can check out the github repo, https://github.com/Sence-Org/Sence. You can also send any feedback you have to feedback@sence.club. Both would be of immense help.

Thank you so much for reading and for sticking around.
