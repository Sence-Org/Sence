It has been 3 weeks since the last post. In that time period, I'm positive that some users (if there were any on the website save for a few friends) had lost interest in the website thinking we had abandoned it. I have not. And I will never abandon the website. I won't say that I've been working on some major changes either because I wasn't. In that 3 week period, Samual didn't have much free time to work on Sence and therefore we couldn't do a lot of stuff other than just keep on adding posts which wasn't what I wanted to do. Not with the website still in this state.

Samual has told me that he does not wish to work on Sence anymore as he does not have the motivation to work on it at the moment. I fully accept and respect his decision. For the moment, I am the sole maintainer and developer behind this website. This means development will go a bit more slowly, considering my lack of experience in back-end development (and front-end development too, though I have learned a bit since we started working on the website). I will not let this bring me down though, nor will it limit Sence in any way.

For now, I will maybe add a few more posts before I get to work on the back-end of the website. In the time of writing and adding those posts I will try and learn as much as I can about back-end development and hopefully, I will have a back-end for the website in a relatively short time. The website can only go for so long in its current static form.

For anyone who's still sticking around whether out of interest in the website's concept or for any other reason, thank you. Feedback about both the posts and the website itself can be sent to <feedback@sence.club>. Trust me, it will help a lot. You can also check out the GitHub repo for the website if you'd like, <https://github.com/Sence-Org/Sence>.

Thank you so much for reading and for sticking around.
